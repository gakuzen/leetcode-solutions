# 53. Maximum Subarray

> Given an integer array nums, find the contiguous subarray (containing at least one number) which has the largest sum and return its sum.
>
> Example:
>
> Input: [-2,1,-3,4,-1,2,1,-5,4],
> Output: 6
> Explanation: [4,-1,2,1] has the largest sum = 6.
> Follow up:
>
> If you have figured out the O(n) solution, try coding another solution using the divide and conquer approach, which is more subtle.

## #1 Solution

- Approach: Brute force
- Time complexity: O(n^2)
- Space complexity: O(1)

## #2 Solution

- Approach: Kadane's algorithm
- Time complexity: O(n)
- Space complexity: O(1)
